  # auth_token_file must be a filename.
  #   If just a filename it will be searched for in ".", "~/.weka", and "./.weka"
  #   This file can be generated with the 'weka user login' command and copied to where we are running
  # hosts is a list of hostnames or ip addresses.  Minimum of 1 required.  You do not need to list all hosts in the cluster

#  category:
#    statistic: unit_of_measurement
#    statistic: unit_of_measurement
#    statistic: unit_of_measurement
#
# if you are familiar with "weka stats", these are "--category <category> --stat <statistic>"
#
# For more info refer to: https://docs.weka.io/usage/statistics/list-of-statistics
#
# To monitor additional statistics, just uncomment the ones you want to be gathered/reported
# If uncommenting things in a commented out section/Category (ie: 'object_storage:), don't forget to uncomment
#   the Category itself (eg: "# 'object_storage:") as well as one or more of the metrics under it
#   These lines are marked "# Category"
#
# It does not like Categories with no metrics - fix forthcoming
#   meanwhile, don't uncomment a Category without uncommenting at least one statistic under it.
